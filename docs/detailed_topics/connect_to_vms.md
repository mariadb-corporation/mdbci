# Connecting to the Virtual Machine using SSH file
You can connect to the VM using an SSH file using the command:
`ssh -F name_ssh_config node_name`.
* `file_ssh_config` this is the name of the SSH file. The file is located in the same directory as the template.
* `node_name` this is the name of the node. `node_name` is taken from the template.
